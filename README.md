# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I have created a website that allows me to create notes while I study coding. It gives me a unique website to take down notes for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git while I'm studying these topics. It gave me a chance to learn the basics and gave me a good foundation begin my learning. 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage

 Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and you can choose one topic for us to study first. To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
